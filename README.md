# Demo 2018-03-18 #

Having come off of 7DRL last week I decided to work on a level
generator based on 2D binary space partitioning trees, a classic data
structure for making roguelike dungeons.

I didn't get as far as digging tunnels or adding other features like
doors, stairs, other tile types etc. I just got as far as digging out
the rooms.

I was inspired by the simplicity of the implementation Haskell helped
me discover... so I can safely say that learning Haskell may help you
write better code in other languages.

Refresh to generate a new level.

- Generate BSP: _20 mins_
- Add TileMap: _15 mins_
- Add level generator: _20 mins_
- Render TileMap + debugging: _the rest of the time_
